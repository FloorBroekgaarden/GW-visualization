This directory contains code and files to visualize the existing and expected number of gravitational-wave detections

The main file is the jupyter notebook 
`The (expected) growth of the number of gravitational-wave detections from 2015 to 2040.ipynb`, which runs all the code and together with makeMovie.py makes a movie of all the figures. 

Please do not forget to cite all the actual references (also provided in the tables and in the jupyter notebook itself), this is just a visualization tool :)

GWcatalogData contains the csv files of catalogs for O1, O2, O3 data 

ChatGPT_output contains the images that were used for the Aprils Fools entry
